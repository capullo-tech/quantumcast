/**
 * File-backed [VolumeUndo] in the app's private storage: one `id=percent` line per client.
 *
 * Deliberately a SEPARATE file from the calibration journal, not another field in it. The journal is
 * deleted the moment a run finishes, because a completed run's writes are intentional and blindly
 * reverting them would undo the calibration itself. This record has to survive exactly that moment —
 * it exists so an intentional write can still be taken back afterwards — so sharing storage with the
 * journal would mean sharing its lifetime and losing the record every time.
 *
 * Every failure is swallowed and logged. A storage problem must not crash a calibration, and it must
 * not stop the balance either: the worst case is losing the undo, which is where the feature was
 * before this existed.
