/**
 * Device-level smoke test - the payload of the CI emulator matrix
 * (.github/workflows/EmulatorSmoke.yml, one leg per API level 26-37).
 *
 * The landing page is HomeScreen ("Select a station"), and everything it composes on a fresh
 * install is local: the search field, the Discovery button and the Favorites / Countries /
 * Recordings rows. The radio-browser network calls only fire on search/shuffle, and the local
 * snapcast radar just runs a passive mDNS scan - so "the landing page loads normally" is
 * verifiable without any external service, and any crash under that (Hilt graph, playback
 * service binding, discovery manager) takes the process down and fails the run the loud way.
 *
 * UiAutomator rather than a Compose test rule, deliberately: home runs an infinite
 * scanning-radar animation in the LocalRadiosSection, and a Compose rule's idle
 * synchronization never settles under an infinite animation - every matrix leg would die in
 * waitForIdle instead of testing anything. UiAutomator polls the window hierarchy directly.
